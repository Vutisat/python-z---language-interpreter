z+- language interpreter

 @author Pob Vutisalchavakul 2/5/2015
 This is my first actual program written in Python.
 It interprets the language z+- given a file input.
 The coding can definitely be reduce but the logic currently work, will polish if I have time.

 Please change the file input in line 32 of the program.
 
z+- is a made up language to be interpreted.

Valid statements in z+- are:

Declarations:

DEF hello ; A = 12 ; A = B ;

There are three assignment statements: +=, *=, and -=. These have their usual meaning:

A += 34 ; A *= B ; A -= 34

For Loops:

FOR 5 B += A ; A *= 2 ; ENDFOR
